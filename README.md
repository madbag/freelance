# 🧑‍💻 Freelance Projects

After learning **Responsive Web Design**, I began experimenting with **WordPress**, **Shopify**, and **Webflow**. I’ve had the opportunity to work with two marketing agencies based in Mumbai:  
**Spacebar** and **Upto Design Pvt Ltd** (now merged with **The Brand Brewery**, Mumbai).
